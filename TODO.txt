- ask nick if he can help install dependencies

- obtain html parser

- ask if there's a way to access the lottery APIs so you can do raw get requests to get the numbers if that's how it works (prob not but nice to ask, build the program around html so you don't have to deal with that)

- get daily 3 midday and evening working (as a baseline)

- remember to make cli HUMAN READABLE and USER FRIENDLY if your'e unable to fully automate the process (this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you don't do it I'll EXPLODE)

- add parsing for the actual report (pdf)

- fully automate the process hopefully, unless that isn't allowed
